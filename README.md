Hi! Welcome to one of my projects for The Odin Project. This will be my attempt to recreate the Google home page with HTML/CSS/JS.
Although the classic google search page may look simplistic, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. 
For a basic re-creation though; html structure, form building, media incorporation, and css styling/positioning will be used.
